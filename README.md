# Student Attendance Management 

This project is a simple student attendance management system written in C++. It allows users to add student records, mark their attendance, display their details, and save the attendance records to a text file. The program utilizes standard C++ libraries, including <iostream>, <vector>, and <fstream>, for input/output operations, dynamic data storage, and file handling, respectively. The use of a Student struct helps in organizing and managing individual student records efficiently.



**Overview of tools**

* C++ Programming Language : Utilized for writing the core logic of the application, including data structures, input/output operations, and file handling.

* Standard Libraries:
-> <iostream> for input and output operations.
-> <vector> for dynamic data storage and manipulation.
-> <fstream> for file handling operations.

* Data Structures: struct to represent student records and vector to store a dynamic list of students

* File Handling: Writing student records to a text file using ofstream for persistence.
Here it is : " C:/text files/attendance_record.txt "
